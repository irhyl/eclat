    "## Sociological Theories: Context for éclat\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook synthesizes sociological and related social-science theories that directly inform the design choices in the éclat Master Agent and Worker Agents. Each section summarizes a theory, why it matters for conversational design in financial services, and practical implications for system architecture, UX, or evaluation. References are provided for follow-up reading."

    "### 1. Weber: Rationalization & the 'Iron Cage'\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: Max Weber's concept of rationalization describes how modern bureaucratic systems emphasize efficiency, predictability, calculability, and control. The 'iron cage' metaphor refers to how procedural rationality can trap individuals in impersonal systems, stripping context and dignity from human actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Digital lending workflows often operationalize Weberian rationalization — speed and automation at the expense of user dignity. Understanding this helps explain high abandonment: applicants encounter an impersonal, linear process that fails to account for psychological states. éclat explicitly counters this by re-introducing context, temporal state, and dignity-preserving explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Instrument temporal, human-centered signals (pauses, edits) to reconstruct context lost by rigid workflows.\n",
    "- Provide explainable decision output rather than opaque binary results to reduce the sense of being processed by a machine.\n",

    "### 2. Symbolic Interactionism (Mead, Blumer, Goffman)\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: Symbolic interactionism emphasizes that social reality is constructed through everyday interactions and shared meanings. Erving Goffman's dramaturgical metaphor shows how people present themselves in social encounters, and how small cues shape interpretation and role-taking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Loan applications are social acts — applicants present narratives about their future selves. Micro-interactions (word choice, hesitations, edits) convey meaning that a stateless form cannot. The Master Agent should treat the conversation as an interactional performance, adapting prompts and pacing to preserve face and agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Model conversational roles and acknowledgements explicitly (grounding), not just intent labels.\n",
    "- Use agent responses that preserve applicant 'face' and offer repair strategies when misunderstandings occur.\n",

    "\n",
    "Summary: Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of habitus (internalized dispositions), field (social arenas), and capital (economic, cultural, social) explain how context and background shape choices and interpretations. Habitus orients how users approach formal processes — their prior experiences and expectations affect willingness to continue an interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Different applicants bring differing habitus — some are comfortable with forms and financial jargon, others are not. The system should adapt not just to momentary signals but to inferred dispositions, offering scaffolding where the applicant's cultural capital is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Personalize language register and scaffolding (explain jargon, provide examples) based on inferred user background.\n",
    "- Allow optional modes (guided vs self-serve) and detect when to switch gently.\n",

    "\n",
    "Summary: Grounding theory (Clark & Brennan, 1991) describes how conversational partners establish mutual understanding ('common ground') through acknowledgement, repair, and feedback. Efficient grounding requires explicit checks and short confirmations to avoid miscommunication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Digital conversations must achieve grounding without overwhelming users. The Master Agent should implement compact grounding moves (acknowledge, paraphrase, request minimal clarification) to reduce cognitive load while ensuring correctness (especially for KYC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Use short grounding turns and paraphrases when critical data is collected (names, addresses, PAN).\n",
    "- Apply repair strategies (explicit prompts for clarification) rather than re-asking the full question.\n",

    "\n",
    "Summary: Social presence theory links the perceived 'realness' of an interaction to trust and user comfort. Organizational trust literature (Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995) highlights ability, benevolence, and integrity as trust antecedents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Trust is central in financial interactions. Where systems feel mechanical, trust erodes. The platform must communicate competence (accurate checks), benevolence (respectful communication), and integrity (transparent decision rationale) to retain applicants.\n",

    "Design implications:\n",

    "\n",
    "Summary: The 'dignity of risk' concept from social care argues that protecting individuals' autonomy sometimes requires accepting managed risk; overprotection can strip agency and dignity. In AI-mediated services, preserving autonomy means providing clear choices and comprehensible reasons for decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: When a loan is rejected, how we communicate matters. Providing actionable reasons and next steps preserves dignity and sustains future engagement.\n",

    "Relevance to éclat: Framing communications (e.g., how a sanction preview is presented) can materially affect commitment and perceived value. The Sales Agent's phrasing should avoid manipulative nudges while preserving momentum.\n",

    "Relevance to éclat: Systems should avoid language or interactions that signal blame. When discussing credit weaknesses, provide neutral, constructive language and actionable remediation paths.\n",
