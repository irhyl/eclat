Translating these components into human-readable, actionable reasons reduces user confusion and preserves dignity.\n",

    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Surface which component primarily drove a decline (e.g., PD vs LGD) and the actionable input (missing income proof, high utilization).\n",

    "- When showing sanction previews, include explicit disclaimers and conditional language, and log the provenance (which checks were used).\n",
