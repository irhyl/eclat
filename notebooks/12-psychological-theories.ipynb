    "## Psychological Theories: Context for éclat\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarizes psychological theories and empirical findings relevant to conversational financial interfaces: emotion, cognition, decision-making, motivation, stress, and behavior change. Each section explains the theory, why it matters for éclat, and practical design/measurement implications. References are provided for deeper reading."

    "### 1. Emotion Theories (Basic Emotions, Appraisal, Affective Forecasting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic basic-emotion theories (Ekman) posit discrete emotions with recognizable expressions; appraisal theories (Lazarus, Scherer) emphasize cognitive evaluation shaping emotional responses; affective forecasting describes how people predict future emotional states (often inaccurately).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Real-time emotional signals (sentiment, micro-pauses) can indicate anxiety, confusion, or readiness. Appraisal-focused signals (e.g., perceived fairness, clarity) predict whether a user will continue. Be cautious with affective forecasts — claimed future feelings (e.g., relief on approval) may not match actual outcomes; use them as persuasive aids carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Detect emotional markers (text sentiment, pause patterns) and adapt tone/modality to reduce anxiety.\n",
    "- When previewing outcomes (sanction letter), avoid overpromising — present probabilistic language and next steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dual-process models (Kahneman) distinguish fast, intuitive processes (System 1) from slow, deliberative ones (System 2). Cognitive load theory explains how limited working memory affects task performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Financial decisions require both quick affordances (clarity, simple choices) and moments for deliberation. Too many simultaneous requests or jargon overloads System 2 and increases abandonment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Chunk information and use progressive disclosure; avoid asking for many fields at once.\n",
    "- Provide short, optional explainer modals for users who switch into deliberative mode.\n",

    "\n",
    "SDT (Deci & Ryan) differentiates intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness as core psychological needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Applicants are more likely to persist when they feel autonomous (choice), competent (understandable steps), and related (felt connection). Heavy-handed persuasion undermines intrinsic motivation and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Offer clear choices and simple explanations to support autonomy and competence.\n",
    "- Use empathic, autonomy-supportive language rather than pressure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Transactional stress theory (Lazarus & Folkman) describes primary and secondary appraisal: whether an event is threatening and whether coping resources are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Loan rejections, document requests, or confusing forms trigger threat appraisals. If users perceive low coping resources (complex instructions, slow support), they abandon or escalate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Reduce perceived threat by providing stepwise, low-friction remediation options and quick help links.\n",
    "- Surface small wins (e.g., \"Identity verified\") to increase perceived coping capacity.\n",

    "\n",
    "People rely on heuristics that introduce predictable biases (Tversky & Kahneman). Common biases include loss aversion, anchoring, confirmation bias, and availability heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Messaging, ordering of options, and default values can unintentionally anchor user expectations or exploit loss aversion. The system must avoid manipulative defaults and monitor for biased framing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Avoid anchoring by offering clear, comparable options and transparency about defaults.\n",

    "\n",
    "Relevance to éclat: Automated affect detection can inform pacing, agent empathy, and escalation triggers, but it has accuracy limits and privacy risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design implications:\n",
    "- Use affect signals as soft triggers (non-blocking) and always allow user override.\n",
    "- Be transparent about what is detected and why (consent + explainability).\n",
